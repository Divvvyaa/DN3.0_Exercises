Exercise 1 Inventory System:
Step 1:
Understand the problem:
Why Data Structures and Algorithms are Essential in Handling Large Inventories:
Efficient data structures and algorithms are crucial in managing large inventories because they ensure that operations such as searching, adding, updating, and deleting products are performed quickly and efficiently. With a large number of products, inefficient data handling can lead to significant performance issues, including slow response times and high resource consumption.
Types of Data Structures Suitable for This Problem:
ArrayList:
Pros: Good for storing a collection of products when order matters. Allows fast access by index.
Cons: Slow for searching, adding, or deleting elements unless the operation occurs at the end of the list.
HashMap:
Pros: Provides fast lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. Efficient for managing products using a unique identifier (e.g., productId).
Cons: Does not maintain order. Slightly more complex to implement.
LinkedList:
Pros: Efficient for insertions and deletions at any point in the list.
Cons: Slow for access by index and searching operations.
Given the requirements for efficient data storage and retrieval, a HashMap is a suitable choice for this problem.
4. Analysis
Time Complexity of Each Operation:

Add Product:

Time Complexity: O(1) on average.
Reason: HashMap allows for constant time insertion.
Update Product:

Time Complexity: O(1) on average.
Reason: Similar to insertion, updating a value in a HashMap is also constant time.
Delete Product:

Time Complexity: O(1) on average.
Reason: Removing an element from a HashMap is a constant time operation.
Optimizations:

Efficient Key Management:

Ensure that the product IDs (keys) are unique and consistently formatted to avoid collisions.
Memory Management:

Regularly clean up the HashMap to remove obsolete or infrequently used products to free up memory.
Concurrency Handling:

Use concurrent data structures like ConcurrentHashMap if the inventory system needs to handle multiple threads.
By carefully selecting the appropriate data structure and considering optimizations, the inventory management system can efficiently handle large inventories with minimal performance overhead.
