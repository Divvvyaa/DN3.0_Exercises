Financial Forecasting Tool
1. Understand Recursive Algorithms
Concept of Recursion:

Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.
It simplifies problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems.
Recursion involves a base case (the simplest, smallest instance of the problem) and a recursive case (the larger problem expressed in terms of the smaller problem).
Example of Recursion:
A common example is the calculation of the factorial of a number:
ùëõ!=ùëõ √ó (ùëõ‚àí1)!
0!=1


2. Setup
Create a Method to Calculate Future Value Using a Recursive Approach

In financial forecasting, let's assume we want to predict the future value based on a constant growth rate. For simplicity, we'll assume a fixed annual growth rate.

Future Value Calculation Formula:
Future¬†Value=Present¬†Value√ó(1+Growth¬†Rate)^Years
4. Analysis
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the recursive algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of years.
This is because each call to the calculateFutureValue method reduces the number of years by 1, leading to n recursive calls.
Optimizing the Recursive Solution:

One way to optimize recursive solutions is through memoization, where we store the results of previous computations to avoid redundant calculations.
However, in this particular problem, memoization isn't necessary as each subproblem is unique and not repeated.
