Exercise 6: Library Management System
1. Understand Search Algorithms

Linear Search:
Description: Linear search iterates through each element in the list sequentially until the desired element is found or the end of the list is reached.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) (if the desired element is the first one)
Average Case: O(n)
Worst Case: O(n) (if the desired element is the last one or not present)

Binary Search:
Description: Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works on sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half and compares the target value with the middle element. If the target value is equal to the middle element, the search is successful. Otherwise, the search continues in the left or right half, depending on whether the target value is smaller or larger than the middle element.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) (if the middle element is the target value)
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n)
4. Analysis
Compare the Time Complexity of Linear and Binary Search:

Linear Search:
Best Case: O(1)
Average Case: O(n)
Worst Case: O(n)
When to Use: Linear search is suitable for small datasets or unsorted datasets. It is also useful when the overhead of sorting the data is not justified by the frequency of search operations.

Binary Search:
Best Case: O(1)
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n)
When to Use: Binary search is ideal for large datasets where the data is already sorted or can be sorted. It is more efficient than linear search for large datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.
When to Use Each Algorithm Based on Data Set Size and Order:

Linear Search:
Use linear search when the dataset is small or unsorted.
It is simple to implement and does not require the data to be sorted.
Suitable for scenarios where search operations are infrequent or where the overhead of sorting the data is not worth the performance gain in search operations.

Binary Search:
Use binary search when the dataset is large and sorted.
It is significantly faster than linear search for large datasets due to its O(log n) time complexity.
Suitable for scenarios where search operations are frequent, and the overhead of sorting the data is justified by the performance gain in search operations.
